## Overview ##

**Data file:** case0202

**Description:** Anatomical abnormalities associated with schizophrenia

### Tasks ###

1. Load the data file, find two observed data groups and separate them. Describe these two data groups. For each group find mean, variance and median.
2. For each group try to find probability density function (based on histogram) and distribution function (based on ecdf).
3. For each group find probability distribution.
   1. Approximate parameters of normal, exponential and uniform distribution.
   2. Add appropriate probability density functions (PDF) with estimated parameters to the histogram graphs.
   3. Discuss which of the distribution is best to reflect observed data.
4. For each group separately generate probability sample of 100 values from distribution with parameters estimated in the previous point which you have chosen as the best one.
5. For each group separately compute 95 % confidence interval for the mean.
6. For each group separately, with the 5% level of significance, test hypothesis whether the mean equals value of K (parameter of the task). You can use result of the previous task or output of a corresponding function in your software.
